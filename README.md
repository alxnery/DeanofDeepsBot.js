**DISCORD BOT for playing sound bytes in chat!**

 I've never used javascript before, so this a bit of a learning experience, will continue to update from the ground up maybe it will turn into something. :)

Current functions are youtube, giphy, ttsformatter, half-width to full widthand the ability to define simple commands, mostly dynamic code.

**TO USE:**
Drag mp3 files into a folder in your root directory named 'sounds'
ie(./sounds/);
turn the bot on for an automatic scan of your directory and the ability to call!sound, !sound random, or even something like !sound random filename.

**NEEDS FFMPEG OR AVCONV**
**Also supports nested directories, so feel free to sort those sounds**
